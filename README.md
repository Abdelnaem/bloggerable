## Getting started

### Download

Choose one of the following options:

- [Download the latest release.](#)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/igoynawamreh/blogger-starter.git`

### Build tools

Blogger-Starter uses [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) for its build system.

#### Installing Grunt

1. [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), which we use to manage our dependencies.
2. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
3. Navigate to the root `/blogger-starter/` directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at the `package.json` file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.

#### Available Grunt commands

Our `Gruntfile.js` includes the following commands and tasks:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `grunt dist` | `grunt dist` creates the `/dist` directory with compiled files. |
| `grunt watch` | Watches the source files and automatically building them whenever you save. |
