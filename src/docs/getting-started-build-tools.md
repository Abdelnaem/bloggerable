# Build tools

Learn how to compile the source code, builds the documentation, and more.


## Tooling setup

b:starter uses [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) for its build system. To use our build system, you’ll need a copy of b:starter’s source files and Node. Follow these steps:

1. [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), which we use to manage our dependencies.
2. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
3. Navigate to the root `/blogger-starter` directory and run `npm install` to install our local dependencies listed in `package.json`.

When completed, you’ll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.


## Using Grunt commands

Our `Gruntfile.js` includes the following commands and tasks:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `grunt dist` | `grunt dist` creates the `/dist` directory with compiled files. |
| `grunt watch` | Watches the source files and automatically building them whenever you save. |


## Local documentation

You can run the documentation locally via Grunt commands:

1. From the root `/blogger-starter` directory, run `grunt docs-serve` in the command line.
2. Open `http://localhost:9001` in your browser.

Or, simply open the generated HTML files in `dist/docs` directory using your browser.


## Troubleshooting

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running Grunt commands, first delete the `/node_modules/` directory generated by npm. Then, rerun `npm install`.
